# hedera-hcs-corda

This library provides a implementation of a Notary Service for the [Corda] distributed ledger
platform using the [Hedera Consensus Service] to globally order transaction spends, providing 
Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protection against double-spends without running your own network 
like BFTSmart.
